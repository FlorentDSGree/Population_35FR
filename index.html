	<div class="title2">1. Introduction</div>
	<p>The purpose of this study is to give some basic information about the demography of a French department (Ille-et-Vilaine - 35). 
	   The data are coming from the following French Government API (<a href="https://geo.api.gouv.fr.">link</a>). The data used were 
	   up-to-date as of December 2018. The data have been queried for all the department and then saved as NoSQL database locally. 
	   Thus, there is no need anymore to query from the API (except to update with latest API data) and the analysis can be done 
	   offline.</p>

	<p>Almost 21% of the department population lives in the biggest and most densely populated city, Rennes. The cities with the 
	   highest population have some of the highest density population (i.e. Rennes, Saint-Malo (5th highest density), Fougères). 
	   However, the third highest densely populated city (Bécherel) has only 722 inhabitants. This high density rate is due the 
	   size of its teritory, the smallest in the departement. The opposite phenomenon is happening for Paimpont, which has the 
	   lowest densely populated city due to the very large size of its territory, the biggest in the department.</p>

	<p align="center"><img src="https://florentdsgree.github.io/Population_35FR/Graphs/322_CityPopulationDistribution.png"></p>
	<p>Mind the x-axis unit, logarithmic unit is used here to make the figure more readible. The most representated city population 
	   bin is between 1,000 to 2,000 inhabitants, it accounts for 30% of all the department cities. The second most represented 
	   population bin is the one ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 inhabitants (11%). Cities from 1,000 to 3,000 inhabitants represent 
	   about 41% of the department cities. 37% of the cities have up to 1,000 inhabitants. 68% of the cities have 2,000 inhabitants 
	   or less. Less than 10% of the cities have at least 5,000 inhabitants. Finally, cities accommodating more than 10,000 
	   inhabitants account for only 1% of the department cities.</p>

	<p align="center"><img src="https://florentdsgree.github.io/Population_35FR/Graphs/332_CityAreaDistribution.png"></p>
	<p>Mind the x-axis unit, logarithmic unit is used here to make the figure more readible. The majority of the cities (36%) has a 
	   territory ranging from 10 km<sup>2</sup> to 20 km<sup>2</sup> and 19% of the cities have an area between 20 km<sup>2</sup> and 
	   30 km<sup>2</sup>. Only one city has a territory lower than 1 km<sup>2</sup>. 27% of the cities have an area below or equal to 
	   10 km<sup>2</sup>. 63% of the cities area go up to 20 km<sup>2</sup>. The cities with a territory higher than 30 km<sup>2</sup> 
	   account for a bit less than 10% of the cities. Finally, about 2% of the cities have an area lower than 1 km<sup>2</sup> or 
	   higher than 70 km<sup>2</sup>.</p>

	<p align="center"><img src="https://florentdsgree.github.io/Population_35FR/Graphs/342_CityPopulationDensityDistribution.png"></p>
	<p>Mind the x-axis unit, logarithmic unit is used here to make the figure more readible. The most common density range is between 
	100 pop/km<sup>2</sup> to 200 pop/km<sup>2</sup>. More than 50% of the cities have a density of at least 70 pop/km<sup>2</sup>. 
	Around 20% of the cities have a density higher than 100 pop/km<sup>2</sup>.
	
	<div class="title2">4. Density spatial analysis</div>
	<div class="title4">Figure 7: Density of city compare to distance to Rennes</div>
	<p align="center"><img src="https://florentdsgree.github.io/Population_35FR/Graphs/352_CityDensityPopulationVsDistanceToRennes.png"></p>
	<p>The closer, in term of distance, a city is to Rennes (most populated and densely populated city) the higher the population density 
	   is. The density decreases until around 20km from Rennes, for further distance the density is generally constant with values 
	   slightly lower than 100 pop/km<sup>2</sup>. The cities that do not follow this trend are either other major cities or cities 
	   similar as Bécherel which has a tiny territory.</p>
	<div class="title4">Figure 8: Density of city compare to distance between Rennes and Saint-Malo</div>
	<p align="center"><img src="https://florentdsgree.github.io/Population_35FR/Graphs/354_CityDensityPopulationBetweenRennesAndSaintMalo.png"></p>
	<p>The phenomenon as on the previous figure can be seen here, the closer a city is to a major city, the higher the density is. The 
	   bigger the city is the clearer this phenomenon is. Around Rennes, this characteristics is observable up to 20km while for 
	   Saint-Malo it is visible up to about 5-10km.</p>
